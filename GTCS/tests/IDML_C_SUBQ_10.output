The following test is executed in Embedded SQL where it succeeds and 
in ISQL where it fails.  The test is for [illegal ?] syntax:

         INSERT INTO TEST_TABLE1 SELECT S_ROWID, C_ENUS, C_FRANCE, C_437_25 
	       FROM STRING_TABLE ORDER BY C_FRANCE;

Using an ORDER BY in a SUBQUERY is questionable by SQL II standards.  
The Dates book, page 347-349 are given as reference:

    insert   ::= INSERT INTO ...table-exp...
    table-exp::= does not show an ORDER BY allowed anywhere.  Only
		 the GROUP BY is supported and that takes a COLLATE 
		 clause which is how ordered data would be obtained 
		 in an INSERT w/subquery.

From parse.y, which appears to allow the ORDER BY as a result of 
the select definition:

select       : union_exp order_clause for_update_clause
union_expr   : select_exp
select_exp   : SELECT ...
               where_clause --> does not allow ORDER BY here, it comes from 
	                        the 'select' above.
	        group_clause

Program attempting Embedded INSERTw/SUBQUERY and ORDER BY--works!
