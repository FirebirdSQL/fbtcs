Test:
 INSERT BLOB-CURSOR VALUES (Buffer,-1) - Buffer length<0 
              Bufferlen<0 produces core dumps and not allowed. 
 	     BufferLen type should be unsigned short
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A signed short for buff len < 0 produces core dump
A signed short for buff len < 0 produces core dump
A signed short for buff len < 0 produces core dump
A signed short for buff len < 0 produces core dump
