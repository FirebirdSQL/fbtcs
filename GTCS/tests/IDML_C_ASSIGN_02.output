  Using SET NAMES NONE.
  The following test is for embedded field assignment between 
  international fields of dissimilar character sets.  The insert
  is done in embedded with set names ISO, DOS437 and DOS850.  A
  select is done in embedded using the same set names.

  An ISQL verification is then done to attempt to determine it
  the embedded set names was affecting the insert or not.
